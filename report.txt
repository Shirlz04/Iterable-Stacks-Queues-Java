3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Deque): I approached this problem as if I was going to make a class
   that supports the same concepts of stack and queue. Adding to the last of the 
   linked list gave me the biggest issue. When I tried to add to the last node in the 
   list, they would not be added because last was always null. This was because 
   I did not realize that first and last could point to the same node when
    the first node was added.
   

   Problem 2 (Random Queue): At first I misunderstood what was meant by shuffling 
   the items array until I rembered about switching around the items in to variables
    by using a temporary one. In order to make the switching unique it was better 
    to use the random function to decide which index of the array should be switched.

   Problem 3 (Subset): The only thing that needed to be done in this problem was using
   the queue in problem 2 which makes a random queue from the constructor and dequeing 
   the random element on top.
   
4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

    The only help that I recieved from this project was from piazza and the discussion
    session. I did do a little research on the StringBuilder data type to learn what the 
    methods were and how they worked.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I think this project was a really good even though it was not difficult. I
   believe that I've fully mastered the use of linked lists and iterators.
